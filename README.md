# Personal Code Samples – Master CV&DS Application

This repository contains two advanced programming examples submitted as part of the
admission requirements for the Master’s programme **Computer Vision & Data Science** 
at NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences.

All code follows:
- PEP-8 style guidelines  
- Modular and readable structure  
- Efficient algorithmic techniques  
- Pythonic best practices  

## Repository Structure

### 1. Algorithms (Pure Python Implementations)
This folder contains fundamental algorithms implemented from scratch:
- Merge Sort  
- Matrix Multiplication  
- Binary Search  
- Prime Checking  
- Fibonacci (Iterative)

These implementations demonstrate computational thinking, recursion, and algorithmic clarity.

### 2. Machine Learning from Scratch
This folder contains core ML implementations without external libraries:
- Linear Regression (closed-form)  
- A simple Neural Network (1 hidden layer)  
- Sigmoid activation  
- Utility functions  

These demonstrate my understanding of mathematical modeling, optimization, and supervised learning.
