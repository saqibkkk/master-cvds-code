# Algorithmic Sorting – Merge Sort & Quick Sort

This code sample demonstrates my ability to write efficient, modular, and pythonic
algorithm implementations. The module includes two fundamental sorting algorithms:

- **Merge Sort** (divide-and-conquer, O(n log n))
- **Quick Sort** (recursive, partition-based, expected O(n log n))

Both implementations follow:
- Clean and readable function structure  
- PEP-8 style conventions  
- Modular design using helper functions  
- Type hints for clarity and maintainability  

### File Included
- `algorithmic_sorting.py` — full implementation of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and helper methods.

### Purpose
This example demonstrates:
- Recursive algorithm design  
- Efficient list processing  
- Use of helper functions for modularity  
- Working with typed Python collections  
- Producing clear, understandable, and maintainable scientific code  

These algorithms are implemented from scratch without external libraries, showing core programming and algorithmic reasoning skills.
