# Graph Pathfinding – DFS & BFS Traversal

This code sample showcases classical graph traversal algorithms implemented in a
clear, modular, and pythonic way. The file includes:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** — recursive graph traversal  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** — iterative traversal using a queue  

The graph is represented using a Python dictionary with adjacency lists.

### File Included
- `graph_pathfinding.py` — complete implementations of DFS and BFS.

### Key Highlights
- Clean and readable algorithm implementations  
- Use of Python standard library (`collections.deque`)  
- Type hints for improved clarity  
- Demonstrates both recursive and iterative problem-solving techniques  
- Avoids external libraries to focus on core algorithmic logic  

### Purpose
This code sample demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with data structures (graphs, queues, sets)  
- Implement traversal logic from scratch  
- Write efficient and scientifically structured Python code  
- Follow PEP-8 conventions and modular design principles  

These algorithms represent core computational techniques and reflect strong foundational programming skills.
